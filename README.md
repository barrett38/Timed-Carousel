## Installation

Only basic install needed for Frontend needed:

```sh
npm install react-slick slick-carousel
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object

```

## Inspiration:

I did this project because I have been studying the different Rosary Prayers found in the Catholic Church. This will help me with my learning. My inspiration is based on my desire for simplicity. I found one specific site that has this type of simplicity and used elements of its design. The fading in and out is solely my basic design. It adds to the simplicity, i believe. I am happy with how everything turned out.
