      "The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built for Mausolus, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, and his wife, Artemisia, in 350 BC. Standing approximately 45 meters (148 feet) tall, it was an architectural masterpiece combining Greek, Egyptian, and Lycian design elements. The structure was richly decorated with sculptural reliefs by renowned artists. Although the Mausoleum was destroyed by earthquakes, its name became synonymous with monumental tombs.",

      "The Hanging Gardens, said to be built by King Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC, were a legendary terraced garden filled with lush vegetation. According to ancient writers, the gardens were created to please the king’s wife, Amytis, who missed the greenery of her homeland. The gardens were reportedly irrigated by an advanced system using the nearby Euphrates River. However, the existence of the Hanging Gardens remains uncertain, as no definitive archaeological evidence has been found.",

      "Also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, this lighthouse was built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom around 280 BC on the small island of Pharos, off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. It was designed to guide sailors safely into the busy harbor and stood between 100 and 130 meters (330-430 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest man-made structures of the ancient world. The lighthouse was equipped with a massive flame at night and mirrors to reflect sunlight by day. It was severely damaged by earthquakes in the 14th century.",
